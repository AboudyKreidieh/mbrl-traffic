    rho_max_max : float
        maximum possible density of the network (in veh/m)
    v_max : float
        initial speed limit of the LWR model. If not actions are provided
        during the simulation procedure, this value is kept constant throughout
        the simulation
    v_max_max : float
        max speed limit that the network can be assigned
    tau : float
        time needed to adjust the velocity of a vehicle from its current value
        to the equilibrium speed (in sec)
    dt : float
        time discretization (in seconds/step)
    boundary_conditions : str
        conditions at road left and right ends; should either dict or string
        ie. {'constant_both': ((density, speed),(density, speed) )}, constant
